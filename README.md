#DDoS Attack Detection using Random Forest
This repository contains an AI model built to detect Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks in network traffic using the Random Forest algorithm. The model preprocesses network traffic data and identifies whether it is benign or malicious based on labeled data.

Project Overview
This project uses machine learning techniques, specifically Random Forest, to identify patterns associated with DDoS attacks. The model processes network traffic data and classifies it as benign or malicious, enabling early detection and mitigation of DDoS attacks.

Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model is a CSV file (ddos1.csv) that includes features related to network traffic, such as:

Packet rate
Inter-arrival time
Packet size
Duration
Source and destination ports
Number of packets and bytes transferred
Protocol type (converted into dummy variables)
The dataset contains a label column that indicates whether the traffic is benign or part of a DDoS attack.

Requirements
The project requires the following Python libraries:

pandas
scikit-learn
seaborn
matplotlib
To install the required dependencies, run:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
File Structure
ddos1.csv: The dataset used for training and testing.
ddos1.ipynb: The Jupyter notebook containing the DDoS detection implementation.
requirements.txt: A file listing all the necessary Python libraries.
How to Use
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the necessary dependencies by running:
bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Place your ddos1.csv dataset in the same directory as the notebook.
Open and run the ddos1.ipynb Jupyter notebook.
The notebook will preprocess the data, train the Random Forest model, and output the following:
Accuracy score of the model
Classification report (precision, recall, F1-score)
Confusion matrix visualization
Feature importance plot
Model Performance
After training, the model evaluates its performance on the test set. The key evaluation metrics include:

Accuracy: Proportion of correct predictions (benign or malicious).
Precision, Recall, F1-Score: Detailed classification metrics for both benign and malicious traffic.
Confusion Matrix: A visual representation of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions.
Feature Importance: A plot showing which features contribute most to the model's decisions.
Example Output
Accuracy: 95.67%
Classification Report: Detailed breakdown of precision, recall, and F1 scores for both classes (benign and malicious).
Confusion Matrix: A heatmap showing the actual vs. predicted values.
Feature Importance: A bar chart visualizing the importance of different features used for model decision-making.
