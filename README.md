# DDOS-detection-model
This repository features an AI-powered model for detecting Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks in network traffic, using the Random Forest algorithm. The model leverages machine learning to analyze network data and identify attack patterns, providing an effective solution for real-time detection of DDoS threats.
